# Authenticated Live Verified Endpoints

Source: [docs/javdb_api_notes.md](/F:/codx/javdbweb/docs/javdb_api_notes.md)

This file contains live verified interfaces that either returned `JWTVerificationError` without
login or were only verified with authenticated requests in the source notes.

## `POST /api/v1/movies/%s/reviews/%s/report`

- Method: `POST`
- Path: `/api/v1/movies/%s/reviews/%s/report`
- Auth state: Auth required
- Required params:
    - path param `%s` = movie id
    - path param `%s` = review id
- Observed response fields: none observed from successful authenticated call
- Known errors:
    - `GET` on this route -> `404`
    - unauthenticated `POST` -> `JWTVerificationError`

## `DELETE /api/v1/movies/%s/reviews/%s`

- Method: `DELETE`
- Path: `/api/v1/movies/%s/reviews/%s`
- Auth state: Auth required
- Required params:
    - path param `%s` = movie id
    - path param `%s` = review id
- Observed response fields: none observed from successful authenticated call
- Known errors:
    - `GET` on this route -> `404`
    - unauthenticated `DELETE` -> `JWTVerificationError`

## `GET /api/v1/movies/%s/play`

- Method: `GET`
- Path: `/api/v1/movies/%s/play`
- Auth state: Auth required (returns `JWTVerificationError` without `authorization`)
- Required params:
    - path param `%s` = movie id
    - `source_id` (query) — streaming source identifier; determines playback availability
- Optional query params:
    - `from_rankings` — candidate: `"true"`, `"false"`
    - `operation` — candidate: `"play"`
- Observed `source_id` behavior (tested 2026-04-26 with non-VIP account on host `jdforrepam.com`):
    - `source_id=1, 2, 4` → recognised the movie but requires VIP:
      `PermissionDeniedToPayment: 需要VIP权限才能访问此内容`
    - `source_id=0, 3, 5` → no online source available for this movie: `"此影片不支持在线播放"`
- Expected successful response (inferred, not observed — requires active VIP):
    - Success response likely contains streaming URL / playback token
- Known errors:
    - unauthenticated `GET` -> `JWTVerificationError`
    - `POST` on this route -> `404`
    - authenticated `GET` without `source_id` -> `"此影片不支持在线播放"`

    - `period` (optional) — candidate values: `daily`, `weekly`, `monthly`
    - `type` (optional) — candidate values: `0`, `1`
    - APK static evidence for the dedicated `TOP250` page also recovered:
        - `start_rank`
        - `type_value`
        - `ignore_watched`
        - `limit`
    - Note: on the current host (2026-04-26), all param combinations returned the same pre-generated
      ranking data; the params may be functional on hosts with more frequent ranking refresh cycles
- Observed response fields:
    - `generated_at` (string) — date the ranking was generated (e.g. `"2026-04-21"`)
    - `movies[]` — movie list with a `ranking` field (1–10 observed)
    - `current_page` (number)
- Observed movie fields:
    - `ranking` (number) — rank position (1-based)

    - `release_date` (string), `new_magnets` (boolean)
    - `preview_images[]` — array of `{ large_url, thumb_url }`
- Current frontend wiring:
    - top-navbar `排行榜 -> TOP250` currently remains the only ranking-page branch that still uses
      this route
    - the public `有码 / 无码 / 欧美 / FC2` ranking tabs have been moved to `GET /api/v1/rankings`
    - current web client now exposes APK-confirmed `start_rank=1|51|101|151|201`
    - current web client now exposes APK-confirmed `ignore_watched=true|false`
    - current web client still passes `period=daily|weekly|monthly` here while `TOP250` remains only
      partially live-verified
- APK static evidence for `TOP250`:
    - source
      page: [top250_page.dart](/F:/codx/javdbapkre/recovered_flutter_source/lib/astarte/home/top250_page.dart)
    - source
      presenter: [top250_presenter.dart](/F:/codx/javdbapkre/recovered_flutter_source/lib/astarte/home/presenter/top250_presenter.dart)
    - rankings entry presenters also call the same route for their `TOP250` branch:
        - [rank_presenter.dart](/F:/codx/javdbapkre/recovered_flutter_source/lib/astarte/rank/presenter/rank_presenter.dart)
        - [rank_sub_presenter.dart](/F:/codx/javdbapkre/recovered_flutter_source/lib/astarte/rank/presenter/rank_sub_presenter.dart)
    - recovered query builder shape for `getTop250Movies`:
        -
        `GET /api/v1/movies/top?start_rank={...}&type={...}&type_value={...}&ignore_watched={true|false}&page={...}&limit=50`
    - recovered dedicated `TOP250` UI strings:
        - `Can play`
        - `start ranking:`
        - `Unmarked「watched」`
        - `View only videos that can be played online`
        - `View only videos that have not been marked 「watched」`
    - interpretation:
        - `TOP250` is a dedicated page model with its own filters, not just another `period + type`
          variant of the public ranking tabs
    - currently wired APK-safe request shape in the web client:
        -
        `GET /api/v1/movies/top?start_rank=1&type=all&type_value=&ignore_watched=false&page=1&limit=50`
        -
        `GET /api/v1/movies/top?start_rank=51&type=all&type_value=&ignore_watched=true&page=1&limit=50`
